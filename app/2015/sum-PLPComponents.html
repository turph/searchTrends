			<h4>So, what were our visitors telling us about our PLPs?</h4>
			<div class="content-col2">
				<h5>Hey, it's summer!</h5>
				<p>Overall, searches pertaining to Hike & Camp predominate which was not surprising - backpacks, tents, sunglasses and hats.</p>

				<h5>Brand Term Highlights</h5>
				<p>Adjusted for misspellings, The North Face and Arc'teryx are really our top brand searches Consolidating these instances brings a few brands up into the top ten and reorders the bottom slots a little.</p>

				<h5>Category Term Highlights</h5>
				<p>Adjusted for plurals, looks like our visitors are getting outside this summer - backpacks, tents and sleeping bags are the top terms.</p>

				<h5>Category + Gender Term Highlights</h5>
				<p>Two terms dominate the volume; Men's Clothing and Women's Backpacks. Given the vast disparity between these values and the third place term there is probably a larger issue at work here. From looking at historical data, it is very uncommon for visitors to be so grammatically correct in their searches, so the inclusion of the apostrophe in the gender values is an indication that these instances are most likely due to promotional elements driving traffic to search PLPs. This is a limitation in how we have implemented Omniture.</p>

				<h5>Brand + Category Term Highlights</h5>
				<p>Adjusting for misspellings and plurals within this category is difficult at best, there are just too many variations. But as the data shows, the top brands and top categories are represented within the top ten results.</p>

		<h2>What is this page about?</h2>
	  <p class="lead">Facets & MMR</p>
		
		<h5>Facets</h5>
		<p>Facets are broken down into two groups; global and local. Simplistically, global facets show up on all PLPs and are: Brands, Sizes, Colors, Prices, Sale, and Customer Review. Global facets always appear at the top of the list and in this order which is defined in the BCC. Local facets on the other hand are category specific and theoretically pertain directly to the products shown on the page. They are shown after the global facets and their order is also defined in the BCC.</p>
