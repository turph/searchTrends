  <section class="row"><!-- Overview -->
		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>There are potentially dozens of KPIs we could focus on, but we will only focus on a few. These indicators attempt to look at the health of search as a whole.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="row"><!-- Search v Browse Conversions -->
		<h2>Searcher vs Browser Conversion</h2>
    <p class="lead">A bit misleading, but a decent indicator.</p>
		<iframe width="1171" height="465" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/a/backcountry.com/spreadsheets/d/16OHVFAED-LhGNWr6rzcAWRBh2qhcq-Qv17Zqw3rB_jg/pubchart?oid=180801308&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<p class="small"><em>Note: OK, lots of caveats below. This charts intended purpose is for trend and discovering anomalies. Understanding the datas limitation and focusing on overall trend allows us to see if changes in behavior are happening.</em></p>
		<h4>Key take aways</h4>
		<p class="text-center push-20">Search is trending up, while browse is remaining relatively flat.</p>
		<h5>Issue: Visits as a denominator</h5>
		<p>In this chart, the large disparity between Search and Browse is because so much visitor traffic is allocated to the browser. The majority of our site traffic comings from organic searches driving visitors to PDPs, who then either immediately exit the site or perhaps bounce around looking for similar products. Historically, this type of traffic has a very low conversion - therefore we greatly influence the data.</p>
		<h5>Issue: Promos drive to PLP Search templates</h5>
		<p>Because promotional materials drive to search pages, the search portion of this chart will show spikes corresponding to sales periods. This is a limitation in Omniture data collection methods.</p>

			<p class="small"><em>Note1: Browsers will have a lower time on site due to the inclusion of organic search traffic which has a high bounce rate.</em></p>
			<p class="small"><em>Note2: Fraudulent bike orders in June in excess of $1M impacts all financial reporting.</em></p>
			<h4>Key take aways</h4>
			<p class="text-center push-20">Searchers stay on the site longer, look at more pages, and have a higher order amount.</p>
			<div class="content-col2">
				<h5>Average Time on Site</h5>
				<p>There appears to be a very slight increase in searcher time on site and a decrease for the browser. This trend line is very slim.</p>

				<h5>Average Page Depth</h5>
				<p>As with the time on site, there appears to be a very slight increase in searcher page depth and a decrease for the browser. On would assume if time on page is not changing dramatically, a visitor would have to be doing something with this extra time and it would be looking at more pages.</p>

				<h5>Average Order Value</h5>
				<p>For the first 5 months of 2015 there was a steady decline in average order value for both searchers and browsers at a relatively even rate.</p> 
				<p>In June our AOV numbers increased dramatically due to fraudulent bike orders totaling over $1M. We will have to see how the curve balances out with subsequent months.</p>

		<div class="col-md-12 "><!-- Narrative -->
			<h4>Key take aways</h4>
			<p class="text-center push-20">Null search terms is an aspect of SBnR that needs constant attention.</p>
			<h5>Ugg & Uggs</h5>
			<p>Uggs has been leading null search terms for a couple years now. Given that we carry the brand these search terms now resolve and the data shows the dip.</p>
			<h5>Data hiccups</h5>
			<p>In May and June, the term "the north face" appears in the top 10 null search terms. Obviously this should not be happening and since so little time is placed on fixing these issues it is a customer pain point.</p>
			<h5>Make a better Null Search page</h5>
			<p>Given that ~3% of searches result in a Null Search page, we should be doing a better job of recommending brands, products or collections which allow the visitor a better option than a link farm.</p>
